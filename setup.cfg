# You can completely or partially disable our custom checks,
# to do so you have to ignore `WPS` letters for all python files:
per-file-ignores =
  # Allow `__init__.py` with logic for configuration:
  server/settings/*.py: WPS226, WPS407, WPS412, WPS432
  # Allow to have magic numbers inside migrations and wrong module names:
  server/*/migrations/*.py: WPS102, WPS114, WPS432
  # Enable `assert` keyword and magic numbers for tests:
  tests/*.py: S101, WPS432
